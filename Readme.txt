1)I used php extention inorder to use the include function to include header and footer in multiple pages

2)I created mysql database and php code to generate json and read it with ajax

3) What I used:
    dependencies: jquery,jquery ui,aos
    font-family:opan sans
    images: from amazon and undraw
    ajax:fetch data from server
    sass:define primary, secondary colors and mixins
    media queries,flex and grid

4)Inorder to see the website directly without importing the database use the following link: http://ad-shop.epizy.com
